The point of this repository is to allow anyone to create a directory to store their own emacs config files.

All emacs config files are checked in under https://dot-emacs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

&lt;user&gt;



If anyone would like to keep their emacs config files in this repository then contact me and I can add you as a member.  By checking in files to the repository you agree that all of your files will be licensed under GPLv2.

Also, note that we don't provide any downloads but anyone can checkout the files from the repository.
