Frequently Asked Questions about Circe, a Client for IRC on Emacs -*-outline-*-

* General
Q: Where can I get button.el?
A: It's included in CVS Emacs. If you use 21.4, you can get it from
   http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/emacs/lisp/button.el?rev=1.21&root=emacs&view=auto

Q: Why doesn't Circe re-use old channel buffers after the server
   buffer got killed?
A: It is not possible to find out whether we can use that channel
   buffer or not. Doing heuristics will lead to severe confusion when
   the user connects to the same server twice. So we don't do this.
   Use the `circe-reconnect' command in any Circe buffer to reconnect
   to this server.

Q: Can Circe do logging?
A: Yes. Set `lui-logging-file-format' and `lui-logging-format' to
   values of your preference; Circe adds the two format strings
   {target} and {network} to the possibilities for
   `lui-logging-file-format'. To actually enable logging, to
   `enable-lui-logging' on `circe-chat-mode-hook'.

Q: Why does switching to some Circe buffers hang Emacs for a moment?
A: That's because you enabled flyspell for Circe, and ispell.el is so
   intelligent as to start a new spelling process each time the
   dictionary changes. Aspell takes much longer to start than ispell,
   so you could just use ispell...

Q: How can I avoid to tell Lui twice about my friends, both when
   setting the dictionary and when adding them to
   `lui-highlight-keywords'?
A: Use the following function (thanks to paolo on Freenode for the
   idea):

   (defun lui-add-pals (&rest pals)
     "Add PALS to highlighting and correct dictionary.
   Every PAL is a cons cell of the dictionary to use, and a list of
   nick names."
     (add-to-list 'lui-highlight-keywords
                  (regexp-opt (apply #'append (mapcar #'cdr pals))
                              'words))
     (mapc (lambda (dictnicks)
             (add-to-list 'lui-flyspell-alist
                          (list (regexp-opt (cdr dictnicks)
                                            'words)
                                (car dictnicks))))
           pals))

   (lui-add-pals '("american" "leary" "wilson")
                 '("italian" "tonio" "paolo" "pablo"))


* XEmacs
Q: Does Circe run on XEmacs?
A: Yes, she does. Grudgingly, but she does.

Q: Why can't I use the (circe "irc.freenode.net" "6667") on XEmacs?
A: XEmacs doesn't like a port number as a string argument there. Please use
   an integer for this in that environment: 
	(circe "irc.freenode.net" 6667)
